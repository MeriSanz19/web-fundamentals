## **Expanded Timeline of Internet and Web Technologies**

---

### **1. 1970s – Early Internet Foundations**

- **TCP/IP Protocol Development** (1974):
  - Developed by **Vinton Cerf** and **Bob Kahn**.
  - Enables communication between computers across a global network.
  - **First RFCs:** RFC 675: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc675

---

### **2. 1980s – Domain Name System (DNS)**

- **DNS Development** (1984):  
  Replaces static host files, allowing domain-to-IP address mapping.  
  **Key RFCs:** RFC 1034 and RFC 1035:
  - https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1034.html
  - https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035.html

---

### **3. 1990s – World Wide Web and Web Standards Formation**

- **World Wide Web** (1991):
  - Introduced by **Tim Berners-Lee** at CERN.
  - Core technologies: **HTML**, **HTTP**, and **URLs**.

#### **Regulatory Evolution: Formation of W3C (1994)**

- **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** established by Tim Berners-Lee to develop and maintain web standards.
- Early focus: HTML, CSS, and web accessibility.
- Official site: https://www.w3.org/

- **HTML 2.0 and HTTP/1.0**:

  - RFC 1945 (HTTP/1.0):  
    https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1945.html

- **CSS1** (1996):
  - Allows separation of content and styling.
  - Specification: https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1/

---

### **4. Browser Evolution and JavaScript (1995 - 2000s)**

#### **Browser Development Timeline:**

1. **Netscape Navigator** (1994):

   - Early leader in web browsing; introduced **JavaScript**.

2. **Internet Explorer** (1995):

   - Dominated the browser market in the late 1990s.

3. **Mozilla Firefox** (2004):

   - Open-source browser promoting web standards.

4. **Google Chrome** (2008):
   - Introduced V8 JavaScript engine and focus on performance, dominating by 2010s.

#### **JavaScript Creation (1995)**

- Developed by **Brendan Eich** at Netscape to enable dynamic interactions on web pages.
- Standardized as **ECMAScript (ES)** in **1997** by **ECMA International**.
- Current standard: **ECMAScript 2022**.  
  Documentation: https://tc39.es/ecma262/

---

### **5. XHTML and the Early Standards Battle (2000s)**

- **XHTML 1.0** (2000):

  - W3C promoted strict XML-compliant HTML to reduce browser inconsistencies.
  - Specification: https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/

- **Browser Inconsistencies and Backlash**:
  - Developers faced difficulties due to strict syntax enforcement.
  - Emergence of alternative approaches, including **WHATWG** (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) in **2004**.

---

### **6. Formation of WHATWG (2004)**

- **Goals**:

  - Address slow updates and developer needs ignored by W3C.
  - Focus on **HTML5** with real-world web development practices.

- **HTML5 Evolution**:
  - Specification maintained by **WHATWG**:  
    https://html.spec.whatwg.org/
  - W3C and WHATWG cooperated until 2019, when **W3C stopped independently developing HTML**.

---

### **7. HTTP, WebSockets, and Web APIs (2010s)**

- **HTTP/2** (2015):

  - Introduced multiplexing, header compression, and server push for better performance.
  - RFC 7540: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540.html

- **WebSockets** (2011):

  - Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between a client and server.
  - RFC 6455: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455.html

- **Modern JavaScript APIs**:
  - APIs for web applications became standardized:
    - **Fetch API** (for HTTP requests): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API
    - **WebRTC** (for real-time media): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API
    - **WebGL** (for 3D graphics): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API

---

### **8. Transition to HTML5 and CSS3 (2014 - Present)**

- **HTML5** (2014 W3C Recommendation):

  - Unified web standards under **WHATWG** and **W3C** partnership.
  - Introduced native support for multimedia and semantic tags.

- **CSS3**:

  - CSS modular approach with advanced features (animations, grid, flexbox).
  - Current specifications: https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html

- **HTTP/3** (2020):
  - Built on **QUIC** protocol for low-latency, secure connections.
  - RFC 9000: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html

---

### **9. Web 3.0 and Decentralization (2020s)**

- **Web 3.0**:

  - A decentralized web where users control their data and identity.
  - Core technologies:
    - **Blockchain** for trustless transactions.
    - **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)** for distributed data storage: https://ipfs.tech/
    - **Decentralized Apps (dApps)** for various services.

- **Semantic Web**:

  - Advanced data sharing through **linked data** technologies (supported by W3C).  
    Documentation: https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/

- **Current Challenges**:
  - Scalability, interoperability between blockchains, and privacy concerns.
